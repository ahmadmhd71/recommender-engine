# Capstone Recommender System
Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? We can get a feel for how it works by building a simplified recommender of our own!

In this capstone, you will show off your problem solving and Java programming skills by creating recommender systems. You will work with data for movies, including ratings, but the principles involved can easily be adapted to books, restaurants, and more. You will write a program to answer questions about the data, including which items should be recommended to a user based on their ratings of several movies. Given input files on users ratings and movie titles, you will be able to:

1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; and
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings. 
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.

# Running the Project
Before running the project on your computer, you need to download and add these 2 libraries as dependency:<br/>
[edu.duke](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/archives/courserajava.jar)<br/>
[org.apache.commons.csv](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/archives/apache-csv.jar)<br/>
<br/>
After adding these 2 libraries, you can run the Main class. The Main class makes an instance of the class MovieRunnerSimilarRatings
which has several methods. You can change the data in the MovieRunnerSimilarRatings class to see how the program
works and to see different results.<br/>
<br/>
Note: The project is tested with SDK 8.

# Graphical User Interface
The user interface for this capstone is offered by instructors at Duke University. You can view the user interface for the project at the link below:<br/>

Note: the user interface works better on large screens. If you use a mobile device, rotate the screen.
